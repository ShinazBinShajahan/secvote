# secvote
A web application using Django framework, SmartPy, and Tezos blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent voting system. The application allows users to cast their votes and view the results on a public front-end based on blockchain technology. 

# Introduction

The need for a transparent and secure voting system has become increasingly important in recent times, and the blockchain technology offers a solution to this problem. The use of blockchain technology ensures that the voting process is tamper-proof and transparent. This report provides details on the development of a web application that leverages the benefits of the Tezos blockchain technology to enable vote counting and display the results on a public front-end.

# Development

The web application was developed using the Django framework, a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. The application was designed with a user-friendly interface that allows voters to cast their votes and view the results in real-time.

The Tezos blockchain technology was integrated into the application to ensure that the voting process is transparent and tamper-proof. The use of blockchain technology ensures that the voting process cannot be compromised, and the results cannot be manipulated. The blockchain technology also ensures that the data stored on the network is immutable, making it impossible to alter the results of the election.

The application was developed to enable easy integration with various front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application also supports RESTful APIs, enabling easy integration with other applications.

# Results

The application was successfully developed and deployed on a live server, enabling users to cast their votes and view the results in real-time. The application was also designed to be highly scalable, enabling it to handle large volumes of traffic without any issues.

# Conclusion

The development of a web application using the Django framework and Tezos blockchain technology offers a secure and transparent voting system. The application was designed with a user-friendly interface and supports various front-end technologies, enabling easy integration with other applications. The application was successfully developed and deployed, providing a scalable solution for vote counting and display.
